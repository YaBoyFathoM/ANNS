    RHLF has proven an effective alignment strategy for LLMs, but remains limited by the cost of contract labeling and a scarcity of relevant datasets.<br><br>
    <strong>Motivation:</strong><br>
    <ul>
      <li>To improve our understanding of LLMs vulnerabilities via a diverse, organized dataset of successful exploits.</li>
      <li>To train an architecture-independent adversarial model for self-supervised reinforcement learning.</li>
      <li>To establish a standard metric for LLM behavior evaluation.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <strong>Methodology:</strong><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide an infrastructure for the public to post and complete “bounties” by invoking specific behavior in their chosen model</li>
      Evaluate user submissions in three steps:
          - Is a chat conversation
          - Is the specified model
          - Is pass/fail
      <li>Clean submission and divide text into human and model, labeling goal prompt as the bounty description.</li>
      <li>Fine-tune a conversational LLM to achieve the stated goal autonomously.</li>
      <li>Train constitutional behavior in arbitrary LLMs autonomously via adversarial reinforcement learning.</li>
    </ul>
